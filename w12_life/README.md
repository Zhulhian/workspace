# Life

A computer lab in the introductory programming course at Lund University.

## Usage

This lab makes some usage of the user interface framework JavaFX.

This is a somewhat recent framework that should work well on all systems with Oracles Java SDK installed.
However, not all Linux systems use the Oracle SDK by default and instead use OpenJDK which does not bundle JavaFX.

To use JavaFX on such a system one must also install the OpenJFX package which is supplied by a varge range of distributions.

Install OpenJFX on Ubuntu with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install openjfx

Install OpenJFX on Arch Linux with the following command:

    sudo pacman -S java-openjfx
